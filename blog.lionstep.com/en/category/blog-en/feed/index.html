			<p>While there are numerous recruiting techniques that companies utilize to attract a candidate, some techniques work while others are a flop. If you want to attract a specialist &#8211;  a superstar who will become actively engaged in your company &#8211; you must do things differently. The same old recruiting techniques aren’t always effective, even though you may have been using them for years. Here are three problems that need to change when it comes to recruiting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>1. Time is Wasted Time on the Job Boards</h2>
<p>If you want to <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3050570/why-companies-make-bad-hires">find the perfect candidate</a>, you don’t want to spend all your time on job boards. Many of the best individuals are actively engaged in their jobs. They are invested in their current companies and aren’t actively job hunting. You need to <a href="https://lionstep.com/frequently-asked-questions">discover methods, tools, and technology</a> to reach out to these individuals. In-house referrals, social media, even cold outreaches to individuals who interest you can help fill vacancies quickly. Remember that if you want superstars working for your company, you must put in a little extra effort to find them. The amount of effort you put forth to fill open jobs will reflect the quality of candidates you find.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>2. The Process Takes Too Long</h2>
<p>For many companies, it takes several weeks and even months to fill open positions. They delay the process because they are waiting for the perfect candidate to walk in the door. Because of this long delay, companies often don’t respond quickly to their candidates. When companies leave job-seekers waiting, it creates a negative impression of the company. In fact, long delays can cause candidates to look elsewhere, causing the company to lose out on an individual who could have truly enhanced the team. As you begin your recruitment process, make candidate communication and an expedited process a priority. If you need help, <a href="https://lionstep.com/en">work with a company</a> or a headhunter who can help you find the right talent quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3. Recruiters Focus Too Much on the Resume</h2>
<p>While an individual needs a certain level of qualifications and experience to succeed in a position, their list of achievements and past experiences are not all that matters. In fact, recruiters need to <a href="https://www.recruiter.com/i/7-things-wed-like-to-change-about-recruiting/">focus on a person’s characteristics</a> to get to know a candidate — more than just what’s listed on a piece of paper. A few questions to consider when hiring include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this individual teachable?</li>
<li>Is this person a team player?</li>
<li>How likely is this person to become invested in the company or would this just be a stopping point as they climb the corporate ladder?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of disregarding individuals due to a lack of qualifications, take a closer look beyond their resume at their personality and what they could offer the company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of your current recruiting techniques may work and they may work well. However, if you want to hire candidates who will stick around, who will become actively engaged in your company, and who will be a great asset to your organization, there are many recruiting techniques that must change. You need to start thinking outside of the box to find the best people for your team.</p>

			<p>We all know that one of the most challenging tasks for a business owner or HR manager is finding knowledgeable and dependable employees. Finding them quickly is even more difficult. Unfortunately, the task is harder if you have to sort through resumes and interview candidates in addition to all your other daily tasks. Make the recruitment job a little easier with these ten head hunter tricks to finding a great employee in record time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h4>Geography Isn’t Everything</h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Have you considered <a href="https://fitsmallbusiness.com/find-employees/">expanding your area reach</a>? The internet connects us all, so why shouldn’t it connect your employees with you? If you have positions that can be performed remotely, try using that aspect as a way to entice job seekers. Working from the comfort of home is a huge draw for people who already sit at a computer all day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h4>Know What You’re Looking For</h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don’t know what professionals are looking for in a job, how are you going to attract them? Hit up job boards and look at descriptions and research what job titles are currently trending. Then, work with the department managers or business leaders for the roles you’re looking to fill and gather industry information from them on what you should look for. The more specific you can be, the better, so make sure the right leaders are involved in providing you with as much information as possible to attract the best people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h4>Ensure Your Reputation is Spotless</h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p>No one wants to work for a company that has a bad reputation. If your company isn’t playing up how amazing it is to work for, start doing it now. Have your employees write honest reviews online and make a page dedicated to why your company is a great place to work. What can you offer potential employees?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h4>Encourage Employees to Help</h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.thebalance.com/top-tips-for-successful-employee-recruiting-1918953">Employees</a> are often a great source of assistance in finding qualified candidates. Ask them to help by posting on social media that you’re looking for specific talent. Everyone has a network, so make sure you’re accessing it with your search. Adding a benefit for an employee referral isn’t a bad idea either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h4>Check with Alumni Networks</h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Local colleges have lists of graduates and what degrees they obtained while there. Ask for a link to their network or a list of graduates and contact info in specific fields.</p>

	</div> 

	<div  class="vc_col-sm-6 wpb_column column_container vc_column_container col no-extra-padding"  data-border-radius="none" data-shadow="none" data-border-animation="" data-border-animation-delay="" data-border-width="none" data-border-style="solid" data-border-color="" data-bg-cover="" data-padding-pos="all" data-has-bg-color="false" data-bg-color="" data-bg-opacity="1" data-hover-bg="" data-hover-bg-opacity="1" data-animation="" data-delay="0">
		<div class="vc_column-inner">
			<div class="wpb_wrapper">
				
	<div class="wpb_text_column wpb_content_element " >
		<div class="wpb_wrapper">
			<ol start="6">
<li>
<h4>Hit Social Media</h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you aren’t utilizing social media, you could be missing out on tons of great talent. Check over specific industry-related hashtags for the area you’re hiring in. People who use or search for these hashtags are trying to display their expertise in this area or are looking for opportunities. Many also have resumes already posted on their social profiles, making it quicker and easier to see a person’s credentials at a glance. Going out to find candidates in this type of active sourcing is a great way to find talent and it’s a more proactive approach than simply waiting for applicants to come to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h4>Simplify Your Application</h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A challenging application is one of the biggest turn-offs for potential recruits. Place a<a href="https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/hr-magazine/0716/pages/12-recruiting-tips-from-talent-acquisition-leaders.aspx"> simplistic application</a> on your site first, then include a more in-depth one later if they get through the first screening stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<h4>Use an Excellent Recruiting Company</h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Recruiting companies are not created equal. Make sure you are using a talented agency to search for potential hires. They will weed out the ones who are potential flight risks and zero in on the most talented and experienced options for your needs. <a href="https://lionstep.com/en">Lionstep</a> is a great option for beginning a recruitment search and they offer a free trial for first-time users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<h4>Be Realistic</h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no such thing as a perfect candidate who has all the experience, education, and character traits you’re looking for. Instead, follow an 80/20 rule with your recruitment strategy where you seek out candidates that are almost perfect, but not quite. Leaving a little leeway for someone to grow into a position will open up a bigger talent pool than being narrowly focused on finding “the one.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<h4>Target Another Company’s Talent</h4>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This seems sneaky but it’s really not. Why shouldn’t you become a head hunter for a competent professional in the field you’re hiring in? You may be able to offer benefits that they aren’t currently receiving.</p>
